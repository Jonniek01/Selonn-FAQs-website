                              <p>Selonn is an application that focuses on enabling small and medium scale operators to sell on the internet and buyers to find and buy from the nearest and best sellers.

                            <p>The first thing to start using Selonn is to create an account as either a seller  or as a  buyer.</p>
                            <p>When you create an account as a seller, you are able to post different products under different categories on the app. Selonn takes the precise location of your point of sale (farm,shop, store etc.) and uses it to help buyers navigate their way to you as well as to calculate for the buyers with the nearest seller of the product they want from their search location. As a seller you are then supposed to maintain available status on each available product and toggle to unavailable status when out of stock. This saves buyers from coming to your store when a product is out of stock. For the best experience of the buyer, a product turns unavailable automatically after six hours from last update and the seller has to update its status again. As a seller, you are also able to navigate the app as a buyer.</p>
                            <p>When you create an account as a buyer, you are able to search for a product and find different sellers starting from the nearest sellers. You can also filter products for a certain radius or by the ratings of the seller to buy from the best. Through the app you are also able to compare different prices from different sellers. As a buyer, you are not visible to other buyers.When you create an account as a seller, you are able to post different products under different categories on the app. Selonn takes the precise location of your point of sale (farm,shop, store etc.) and uses it to help buyers navigate their way to you as well as to calculate for the buyers with the nearest seller of the product they want from their search location.

                            <p>The main goal of the founders of Selonn is to use technology to solve the problems in the society they live in and improve the quality of life of the society. Over several years since the invention of the internet, there has been dominance of utilization of the internet by large scale operators as their scale of operations enables them to afford paid advertising and marketing , creating websites etc. With small and medium scale operators being left largely out of the internet, economical imbalance has continued to grow. </p>
                            <p>Selonn helps small and medium scale operators sell their products online which enhances balanced economic growth. Selonn exposes sellers to an unlimited market and to technology. Through the app, local sellers can be discovered by new local buyers as well as buyers out of localities.

Through the App, buyers are able to search for a product and find the seller(s) nearest to them as well as explore sellers in a location. Buyers are able to give feedback to a seller in terms of ratings which encourages production of high quality products and services. Buyers are able to compare prices from different sellers on the app among many other benefits which improve efficiency. By buying through Sellon , a buyer is able to promote small scale and medium scale businesses and promote their growth which comes with creation of employment, balanced economic growth etc.</p>

                          <p>The Sustainable Development Goals or Global Goals are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a "blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all". The SDGs were set up in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly and are intended to be achieved by the year 2030.
                          </p>
                          <p>Selonn , besides solving for other goals, focuses more on solving for the UN's tenth goal: Reduced Inequalities. According to the United Nations, Income inequality is on the riseâ€”the richest 10 percent have up to 40 percent of global income whereas the poorest 10 percent earn only between 2 to 7 percent. If we take into account population growth inequality in developing countries, inequality has increased by 11 percent. Income inequality has increased nearly everywhere in recent decades, but at different speeds. It's lowest in Europe and highest in the Middle East. These widening disparities require sound policies to empower lower income earners, and promote economic inclusion of all regardless of sex, race or ethnicity.</p>
                          <p>Selonn is ensuring reduced inequalities by empowering SMEs by providing them with a platform where they can exploit the vast market in the internet and in the most efficient way. Through Selonn, sellers sell their products at better prices as well as be beneficiary of other technologies such as mobile banking and internet marketing. Selonn also eliminates market frictions between buyers and sellers such as Intermediaries and inability for sellers and buyers to link up.</p>
